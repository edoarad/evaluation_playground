    "# Context\n",
    "## DataPond\n",
    "* DataPond is an impact startup in the seed funding stage, they have developed a technology to monitor water quality cheaply and scalably. \n",
    "* Their primary innovation is the use of cheap ($10s) sensors to algorithmically infer the existence of biological contamination.\n",
    "* They are planning on working in India, where they have solid connections and expertise, and in concordance with the national Jal Jeevan Mission to deliver piped water to all households. \n",
    "  * However, investor preferences and the operational challenges involved in working with the Indian public sector might shift their efforts to the US market.\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "* Water-borne diseases are a huge problem worldwide. \n",
    "  * About 2 billion people live without access to safe drinking water.\n",
    "  * Diarrheal diseases alone are responsible for more than a million deaths each year, a third of which are children under 5.\n",
    "* Current data collection of water quality is severely lacking\n",
    "  * Testing for biological contamination directly is complicated and expensive, so itâ€™s used sparingly (even in developing countries).\n",
    "  * Water treatment and infrastructure operations operate while practically ignorant of water quality status and are thus considerably less effective.\n",
    "* Dealing with an identified water contamination is relatively simple.\n",
    "  * Methods such as chlorination and boiling may be used at the household level if alerted to the contamination. \n",
    "  * Installing water treatment facilities, navigating people to non-contaminated sources, and treating the upstream contamination source directly might be even more promising.\n",
    "* Recently, GiveWell [evaluated water-treatment interventions](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions) (such as chlorination tablets), and it seems highly promising. They are focused on interventions that add chlorine to water (say, by installing water dispensers or in-line chlorination), which generally seems not to work well in India due to poor adherence.\n"
